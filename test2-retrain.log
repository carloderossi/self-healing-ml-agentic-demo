[ORCH] === Round 2 ===

[MONITORING_INTERPRETER] Raw LLM response:
```json
{
  "issue_type": "data_drift",
  "suspect_features": ["income"],
  "severity": "high",
  "reasoning": "The feature 'income' has a PSI value of 4.66, which is significantly greater than 0.1, indicating potential data drift. The accuracy drop from the baseline to the current model is -0.0833, suggesting a notable decrease in model performance. Comparing this round with the past incident report, where all feature PSI values were 0.0 and there was no indication of data drift, it is evident that there has been a change in distribution for the 'income' feature, leading to a higher severity issue."
