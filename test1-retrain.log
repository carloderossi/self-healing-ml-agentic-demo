  "severity": "high",
  "reasoning": "The feature 'income' has a PSI value of 4.66, which is significantly greater than 0.1, indicating potential data drift. The accuracy drop from the baseline of 0.6667 to the current accuracy of 0.75 suggests an improvement, but the presence of high PSI indicates that this change might be due to a shift in distribution rather than improved performance. This differs from the previous round where there was no reported data drift and the model's accuracy actually increased. The high PSI for 'income' is a clear sign of potential issues."
